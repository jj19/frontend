You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I've learn how to use Atom Text Editor as well as learning about and from Stack and the Udacity comunity. Also that studying day to day vs. devouring a tutorial stays longer.

It has been easy to recap on a lot of the HTML and how it has changed since XHTML.

It has been difficult keeping up to date with all thats happening in the Slack channels and the forums.

So far a lot of the material covered I had already sort of experienced just refreshing.
